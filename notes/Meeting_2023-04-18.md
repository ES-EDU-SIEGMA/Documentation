# Meeting: 2023-04-18

We shouldn **not write a new code** unless we can justify it well!

Every **two weeks**, we will select **a new sprint leader**.
**David** was appointed as the current sprint leader **till 01.05.2023**.

During the meeting, we discussed the customer's requirements and identified them by priority:

0. Ensuring **food safety** (We should consider related material standards.)
1. **Easy to clean**
2. **60-seconds** operation time after choosing a drink
3. Accurate dosing (Â± 5 ml)
4. **Recipe** insertion and modification ability
5. collect, store, and show **statistics** of the types of drinks made(user statistics), and the machine status(Hardware statistics for maintenance)
6. Dispense **Sparkling Drinks**
7. Split Admin and Gust View or **User rights** (**We must ask for more details**)
8. Improve **User Interface** for an enjoyable usage
9. Dispense **milk**

- [x] Then, we converted customer these requirements into user stories and created them on GitLab. We also created templates for user stories, which consist of three parts: role, action, and purpose.
- [x] We derived tasks from the user stories and also noted them in GitLab.

food safety should always be given top priority, and cleaning would be a trade-off with usability, which we would need to balance.

**The first iteration** will be a system test, which will involve getting the mixer to work with the software.

- [x] We scheduled a system test for Friday.
